      "notes": "<strong>Agreeable Melancholy</strong> is a piano solo first written in February 2010 and rewritten in November.<br /><br />The title, \"Agreeable Melancholy\", is an oxymoron which describes a slightly ambivalent and conflicting feeling. In order to address such emotion, this piece takes advantage of major seventh chords and augmented chords by presenting them and resolving with consonant explanations. In general this piece is quite plain, and its structure is in straightforward ternary form. However, chord progressions differ in two A sections: the first one contains chords that sound twisting because of high degree of inversion and clashes of dissonant intervals, while the latter features diatonic chords in root position and different cadence in hopes of bringing peace and additional sorrow. In this way it constructs a tranquility - paroxysm - tranquility contrast as the basic contour line of emotion, yet one can sense the difference between two A sections.<br /><br />The composer has no intention to impose restrictions on how to play this piece. Nevertheless, the original idea of this piece is to play softly in both A Sections in general, a little harder in the latter part of the first A section, and being passionate in the B section as if to reminisce the good old days. Feel free to emphasize the contrast and rubato throughout the piece.<br /><br />It was performed by the composer in <strong>Tsang Shiu Tim Art Hall</strong> in <strong> the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology</strong> on <span class=\"date\">2010-12-02</span>.<br /><br />Dedicated to <strong>Irene Zhang</strong>.",
