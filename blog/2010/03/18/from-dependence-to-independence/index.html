        <p>The recent experience in UPenn helps me understand why it is important to put independence before interdependence. Think about this scenario: suppose you want to invest in interdependent relationship. If succeeds, you gain a lot more than you can do when you are alone. If fails, the loss depends on what type of person you are. If you are dependent, you lose everything by the definition of “dependence”: you can only rely on one thing at one time. This is not true in general, but it is possibly true for a dependent person. He or she trusts his / her parents or loved one without preconditions, but the choices are mutual exclusive. If you are independent, you move backward to your original state “independence”, which is still acceptable. This is not so bad so the investment is profitable.</p>
<a id="more"></a> 
<p>Given the couple are rational, one of whom is dependent while the other one is independent before the relationship, they will probably have their own choices that don’t match each other, but it is still reasonable. The risk for dependent to engage in an interdependent relationship is so high that the relationship itself cannot provide sufficient premium corresponding to the risk. The smart choice is undoubtedly to forsake the relationship.</p>
<p>Tragedies always start with inability to distinguish mutual dependent relationship from interdependent relationship. The test however, is quite straightforward: if both are independent, the relationship is most likely to be interdependent, vice versa. The question is how to know whether he or she is independent or not. This is not an easy question, especially if you don’t know actually independence also has different layers, when different kinds of independence are not necessarily true at the same time.</p>
<p>People believe what they see, and they tend to judge whether someone is independent by investigating his financial income and the place he lives in. Financial independence as well as physical independence is the most obvious independence we can tell by looking at the person. In fact most of us use this judgment as the final answer without further thinking. Is that correct?</p>
<p>The defining attribute is emotional independence. It is vital yet obscure. Interestingly, emotional independence is totally “independent” from other independence. You can be physically independent yet emotionally dependent. Do you have friends or family members you can turn to, can share your secrets to, or simply, can trust? Do they allow you to get out of their sight, either physically or emotionally? The first question is a diagnostic test which indicates whether you have emotional dependency. The second question suggests whether the dependency is exclusive.</p>
<p>Emotional dependency is not a bad thing. In contrast, it is essential to our life. Hence we cannot define absolutely emotional independence, but rather in relative way. If we have multiple emotional dependency source, we say we are emotionally independent because any one of these emotional dependencies cannot affect us too much. If we have only one or two dominant emotional dependencies, we are in the state called “emotional dependence”. The critical part is the liability of the emotional dependency. Good emotional dependency should be diversified, because dependency is risky. You cannot rely on only one or two people, even if they are your parents. As you can see below, emotional independence and the liability of emotional dependency are correlated.</p>
<p>To justify the conclusion above, let’s figure out how emotional dependency works. It is, essentially, a stablizer network. Every day people encounter things that rock and things that suck. But no matter what kind of incidents occur, they need either to share their happiness (which amplifies their sense of happiness) or to complain about the FMLs. When you are up, they share your happiness; when you are down, they try to stablize your emotion. People don’t randomly pick up a person and tell him how awful their ex are. As a result, stablizers only accept information at particular frequency which is defined by the sender and stablizer itself (because you are not going to tell them your nasty wrongdoing anyway). The thing is, you must have a stablizer which is available and at right channel when you want to talk. This is not always possible if your stabilizers are extremely limited.</p>
<p>Family (especially parents), at this point, seems to be a fascinating choice. With high availability and broad spectrum of radio frequency, it feels like a stock with high rate and low risk in a market. But wait. It is not that simple.</p>
<p>To begin with, family is not always stable and available. For a typical family with a child aged ten, there is no doubt that the family works as a stablizer, and it functions pretty well. The same thing does not hold for a family with a “child” aged twenty-something, when the parents are challenged by financial issues, health issues and potential “enemies” who are going to take their precious yet “naive” children away. If you are one of the children (or even worse, “the only child” which is the case under one-child policy), you can feel the difference which cannot be simply tagged as “outgrowth of menopause”. Now you know your role in the family has changed. You are not supposed to be stablized; you are to stablize the family. In order to stablize the family, you yourself must be stable independent of the family’s emotional stability.</p>
<p>Secondly, family has been proved for long that it is the ultimate stablizer from day one. Some people find the dependency so addictive that they don’t have the incentive to find another stablizer; it is cheap and good, why bother to find another one? When they realize (some of them never will!) it is not cheap and good for always, they are hooked — the dependency becomes mutual and exclusive.</p>
<p>Mutual and exclusive dependency is perilous not only because it prevents new dependence source, but also because it is difficult to acknowledge. Few adults are willing to acknowledge the existence of emotional dependency, whether it is related to their friends, “more than friends” or children. If the dependency is exclusive, they tend to find more reasons to justify or deny the exclusion. This is not something new; we do it all the time. Most of the matures make decisions in this way: we have some thoughts under the table, some of which cannot possible tell others. And we make a decision. Not done yet. Now we start to think about why this decision is correct. When we share our thoughts with others, we talk about our thoughts on the table and swallow those under the table. Sometimes we can even convince (or rather, deceive) ourselves we actually think in the way we talk to others!</p>
<p>Thus, we need a diversified portfolio of emotional dependencies to be emotionally independent, particularly when our families and love ones need a stablizer who is available all the time and most importantly, stable.</p>
