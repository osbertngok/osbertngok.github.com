        <p>Getting a well paid job or having a respected occupation doesn’t necessarily make one content with his life. In <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs" target="_blank" rel="external">Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs</a></strong>, such accomplishment probably enables a person to reach the fourth level, i.e. <strong>Esteem</strong>, but he might soon find himself eager to match into the final level <strong>Self-Actualization</strong>.<br><a id="more"></a><br>The following quote from 《孟子·盡心上》</p>
<blockquote>
<p>窮則獨善其身，達則兼善天下。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>defines two levels of self-actualization: when you are not there yet, improve yourself; when you are there, spread your thoughts and influence people.</p>
<h1 id="Level-1-Improve-Yourself"><a href="#Level-1-Improve-Yourself" class="headerlink" title="Level 1: Improve Yourself"></a>Level 1: Improve Yourself</h1><p>The first level of self-actualization, <strong>improve yourself</strong>, is to alter your life from the routine.</p>
<p>Routine life is tedious, sometimes frustrating, as repetitive experience provides diminishing stimulation to our nervous systems during the course. Someday you realize there is no update worth telling your friends. Indeed, big things happen in our life, like getting in a relationship, getting engaged, getting a new job, getting promotion, moving to a new place… But those events are by their nature so far apart that they will not be sufficient to fuel our excitement bar for life.</p>
<p>Altering your life is not only about making life delightful; it is also about gaining control. It gives you the feeling that you are making the decisions, rather than you are forced to do what you have to do. Ownership is important as it impacts the incentive to get things done directly.</p>
<p>However, altering your life is surprisingly challenging. There are at least 3 factors contributing to the difficulty: comfort zone, limit of resources and lack of motivation.</p>
<h2 id="Trap-1-Comfort-Zone"><a href="#Trap-1-Comfort-Zone" class="headerlink" title="Trap 1: Comfort Zone"></a>Trap 1: Comfort Zone</h2><p>Oddly enough, while boredom drives you out of where you are, the warmth of comfort zone on the other hand will pull you back in.</p>
<p>There are too many unknowns out of the comfort zone, and it takes resources to reduce the uncertainty so that moving out is a convincingly good bargain.</p>
<h2 id="Trap-2-Limit-of-Resources"><a href="#Trap-2-Limit-of-Resources" class="headerlink" title="Trap 2: Limit of Resources"></a>Trap 2: Limit of Resources</h2><p>Most of us actually cannot afford dramatic changes. The fact is, we can only spend very limited time and money on the <em>Project Alternation</em>.</p>
<h2 id="Trap-3-Lack-of-Motivation"><a href="#Trap-3-Lack-of-Motivation" class="headerlink" title="Trap 3: Lack of Motivation"></a>Trap 3: Lack of Motivation</h2><p>Last but not least, the new life <em>will</em> become our new routine life, which means boredom will eventually kick in before it starts to pay back. To make it worse, it is even more difficult to maintain the new life than the old one, as the new one requires more investment on resources and higher efficiency, and self-control is always energy-demanding.</p>
<p>Why is it significant? It is all about gaining confidence on your ability to change. People actually benefit from this level without reaching the next one, although it also opens the door to the next level, for you are convinced that you can obtain the resouces and skills necessary to do greater goods.</p>
<h1 id="Level-2-Get-Things-Done"><a href="#Level-2-Get-Things-Done" class="headerlink" title="Level 2: Get Things Done"></a>Level 2: Get Things Done</h1><p>The second level of self-actualization, <strong>get things done</strong>, is to solve real world problems. This is when you can wake yourself up in the morning with your dream, instead of an alarm clock.</p>
<p>(To Be Continued…)</p>
