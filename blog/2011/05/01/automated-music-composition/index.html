        <p>There are many fancy names for automated composition, each of which can be used under different circumstances; but the basic idea is to create a computer program which can imitate the composition process of a human musician.<br> <a id="more"></a> </p>
<p>The problem is, although one can easily judge if a sentence is “good Chinese” or “good English” if he or she is a native speaker, the artistic value of a prose can be somewhat subjective. Same applies to music, as you won’t feel surprised if your friends argue fiercely on whether a particular pop song is terrific or terrible. Lack of unanimous evaluation standard is a major pain to solve the problem. That said, we still have tricks to bypass or at least alleviate the issue. </p>
<p>My Final Year Project with <a href="http://physbam.stanford.edu/~yuey/" target="_blank" rel="external">YU Yue</a>, <strong>Automated Fugue Generation</strong> tries to bite a tiny portion of a tiny segment of Composition Automation the Big Cake. It’s up to everyone to judge how succesful this project is. However, after all this and all that I start to understand the depth of the question “What kind of music do you like?”. Hundreds of thousands of musicians have tried to answer this question since Middle Ages, perhaps even earlier. They sum up the rules and guide the future musicians what they should do and what they should not. </p>
<p>Did they make it? The answer is, it depends. When you look at J.S. Bach’s work and the rules summerized in common practice period, you’ll see Bach probably agree with the rules, though not always. The rules are still being taught in music schools, although modern musicians might not give a damn. The definition the good music changes from generation to generation, from person to person, and it is a fact that we cannot deny.</p>
<p>If we narrow down our scope, say suppose we have decided to follow the common practice rules, what will happen? Can we obtain the masterpieces like Bach’s? Unfortunately, no. The most common result is, the program scores extremely high on “obeying” the rules, but the result is… boring. Horribly boring. There are so many rules that as human beings we take them for granted, but the computers simply have no clue.</p>
<p>One fancinating part of our project is, by the end of the project I have much better understanding than ever before how I like to cook my music.</p>
<p>The following links explain the details of the project.</p>
